Brainfuck DJ converts notes and duration to binary
that is compatible with a four bit dac
It supports 16 Notes
the first bit is on or off

FORMAT:
e4 means eeee
b and b1 both mean b


The format is:
Duration=16 #so e3 is actually e48
Notes=[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,A,R]
#So
#R=00000 #0,rest
#a=00001 #1
#b=00011 #3
#c=00101 #5
#d=00111 #7
#e=01001 #9
#f=01011 #11
#g=01101 #13
#A=01111 #15

#so e2bcd2 is:
eebcdd which is:
+++++++++..------.++.++.

so using one register is faster
